### Prelude:

This version has express, node and mongodb.
This is the foundation of our project.

It is working. When you run the server, you get on the command line "rice", an item in our database "test" that you can find (and edit!) in the "MongoDB Compass" (green leaf icon) app.

### CSS:

It is working.
